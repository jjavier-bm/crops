.. _cl_crops_renumber:

Structure file renumbering
--------------------------

With CROPS you can use a simple command to renumber the residues in a structure file so they follow the position in the original sequence.

.. code-block:: shell-session

   crops-renumber 3org.fasta 3org.pdb --output mydir/

The result of the above call is a new content in the output file ``mydir/3org/3org.seqs.pdb`` containing a minimal output of the original ``3org.pdb`` with the residues of all models and chains renumbered according to residue position in the ``3org.fasta`` sequence. Ligands are renumbered with consecutive indices right after the chain ends.

The output directory argument is optional. If not provided, the results will be saved to the sequence file's directory ``3org/3org.seqs.pdb`` by default.

.. note::

   The residue content and positioning in the sequence and structure files **must** be compatible with each other (i.e. both files should come from the same source). If that is not the case, an ERROR message will appear.
